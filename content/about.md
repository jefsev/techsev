## ABOUT ME<span class="dot">.</span>

I’m a designer and developer living in the Netherlands. I enjoy spending time together with my wife and kids, walking in nature together and playing rough and tumble with my kids.

Most of my week I spend designing and developing websites. Currently I am working at a digital agency where i’m the lead developer and project manager. I have both worked as fulltime freelancer and in fulltime employment.

I love defining the goal of a project and the creative part of matching that with a UX or web design. Coding gives me the freedom of staying true to the original idea and design while delivering a finished product.
