## ABOUT ME<span class="dot">.</span>

Hey there! I'm a developer living in the Netherlands. When I'm not coding, I love hanging out with my family and getting active in nature, whether it's taking a walk or just roughhousing with my kids.

After working for years as a full-stack developer, UX designer, and team leader, I've got all the skills I need to take a website from an idea to a finished product.

I really enjoy a good challenge and learning new things, which is one of the reasons why I love being a software developer so much. There's always something new to learn or a tricky problem to solve, and I get a lot of satisfaction from doing both.
