## ABOUT ME<span class="dot">.</span>

I’m a Developer living in the Netherlands. I enjoy spending time together with my wife and kids, walking in nature together and playing rough and tumble. When i'm alone I enjoy reading sci-fi/fantasy novels or occasionally playing a video game.

Most of my week I spend developing websites. Currently I am working at a digital agency where i’m the team lead and developer. I have both worked as fulltime freelancer and in fulltime employment. As a freelancer i also make my own UX Designs using Adobe XD.

I love a challenge and learning new things, being a software developer gives me enough opportunities to tackle a lot of challenges while learning along the way.
